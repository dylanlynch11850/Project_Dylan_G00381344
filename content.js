 <h2>Players:</h2>
 <h6>Mason Mount (Chelsea) – 53 points</h6>
<p>The young English player has a passion for football at the age of 6, after many years of training and playing, the 23
-year-old midfielder has been playing for the Chelsea national team from 2019-2020. Efforts after eight weeks of hard 
work in the season, he received a record of young players scoring at least 10 goals and providing many assists for teammates 
in the same season, helping Chelsea to second place. 3 on ranking table.

Thomas Tuchel understands how important Mount’s role is. Therefore, Chelsea must ensure a long-term future with him to
 continue to be promoted next season, challenging the title race with two potential rivals, Liverpool and Man City.</p>

 <h6>Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool) – 53 points</h6>
<p>Returning from a sprained anterior cruciate ligament injury at the beginning of the season, the Dutchman quickly
     regained his form,
     and with his teammates set a unique record of the season. Liverpool have defended their goal in 21 matches, 
     which means that superstars
      who have faced Liverpool’s goal such as Ronaldo, Mount, .. have not been able to concede just 1 goal in 21 matches. via.

The important person behind is Virgil van Dijk, he has supported the defense very well. So much so that, looking at
 his performances on the pitch,
 you can understand why his name was on top of the Premier League season rankings at the beginning of March. What’s more, every week,
  he still remains to maintain the position of the best player of the season on the rankings.

Dijk joined Liverpool in January 2018 with a record-breaking contract for a centre-back, costing Liverpool £75m 
to complete the transfer process. Not long after joining the team, he brought Liverpool to the final of the UEFA 
Champions League. At Anfield Dijk, he showed the bravery of an excellent leader in defence. If he still keeps his 
form, predicting the future, he will become the best defender in Liverpool history.</p>

 <h6>Harry Kane (Tottenham) – 58 points</h6>
<p>Tottenham had a slow start to the season, and things were not going well when captain Harry Kane played with a 
    noticeable drop in form. A series of rumors broke out while Tottenham showed signs of going down, the press 
    rumored that Kane would move to play for Man City to have tickets to the Euro.

Somehow, the 28-year-old made it into the February player of the season rankings of the season. At the end of the 
Premier League season Kane has scored 5 goals for Tottenham, giving the whole team the opportunity to move on to the 
Champions League, to face Arsenal.

In summary, Kane has had 183 successful shots in the EPL, just 77 goals behind Alan Shearer’s record.</p>

 <h6>Mohamed Salah (Liverpool) – 192 points</h6>
<p>The 29-year-old has given himself 14 of the top assists, and fans must be delighted to praise him, as he has 
    been on the list of the season’s players of the season for 21 consecutive weeks. He deserves the title of top player.

This result is unfortunate for De Bruyne, the injury caused him to suffer pain and could not play. This greatly 
influenced the results. In each position, the players are well deserved for their efforts. Waiting for the miracle 
will come to Man City again next season.</p>

 <h6>Cristiano Ronaldo (Manchester United) – 89 points</h6>
<p>Ronaldo’s performance declined, and Ronaldo’s performance was no longer in his peak when he did not reach the
     top 4 best players of the season. However, CR7 still did not miss the opportunity to shine in the tournament.
      Not letting his legendary title be forgotten, the Portuguese superstar shines with 18 goals for Manchester 
      United in 30 times playing on the field.

The combat ability has decreased, but it is still more than the performance of a normal player. He has failed to 
top the rankings of the top scorers of the season three times. Coach Erik ten Hag, newly appointed at Man United,
 will have a specific plan to exploit Ronaldo’s full potential.

A lot of rumors broke out about CR7’s negative influence on teammates, affecting the spirit of competition of 
club members. Ignoring all the fan arguments throughout the season about Ronaldo’s declining form because no one
 has surpassed his age, we have to accept this fact.</p>
